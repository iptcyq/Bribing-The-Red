# Bribing The Red
A game made for the Historically Accurate Game Jam 5 in a week.
(Very incomplete - and now - two years later - I lack the knowledge to complete a historically accurate game)

The Jam had a theme of "Your Country's History", so the game is about exploiting the reward system the British had during the Malayan Emergency in Singapore/ Malaya from 1948-1960.  


The intended premise: 
- You are playing as a soldier who was part of the Malayan Communist Party when they were forced to retreat into the jungle fringes, turning it into an insurgent emergency.
- You would be going through platformer levels and collecting stuff while you learnt about whats happening to the commonfolk outside the jungle (Briggs Plan; Gerals Templer's appeal to people's hearts and minds; the British gradually relinquishing control, leading to the independence of Malaya).

Making this game was just an excuse to draw the funny propaganda posters I encountered during History lessons :)
